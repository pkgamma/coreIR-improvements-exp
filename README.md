# Core Information Retrieval Report

The passage ranking task, as specified in the Deep Learning Track of TREC 2019, presents the goal of effectively retrieving passages that are relative to the queries, and rank them according to the likelihood of relevance. This two-step process is commonly done by implementing a baseline model (e.g. BM25) and then applying a re-ranking model (e.g. BERT) over the baseline. In this paper, we discuss the potential reasons why certain queries achieve comparably lower retrieval effectiveness, derive our hypothesis and then propose improvement techniques, that increase the performance on baseline BM25 model and the related query types. We also provide analysis and discuss the possible reasons behind this improvement.
